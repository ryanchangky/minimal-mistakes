Hi there!! I'm Ryan!

I am a graduate of the Data Science Immersive programme at General Assembly Singapore. My prior experience includes operations analysis and planning in the defence and healthcare sectors.

I am excited about how data analytics would shape and transform our world. Taking the course would put me in good stead to 
apply data science on real world problems and I continue to practice and hone my skills in order to become better at data science.
